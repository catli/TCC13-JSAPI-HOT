TCC 13 JavaScript Hands On Lab Source files

Not supported by the fine folks at Tableau, but have fun!

- The htdocs folder contains the "starter" harness. 
- Publish the TCCHOL.twbx workbook to your local Tableau Server. IMPORTANT: Make sure to publish with "Show Sheets as Tabs" checkbox selected.
- Follow the informal steps documented in JavaScript API Hands On Training.docx
- If you get stuck there are interim htdocs folders you can grab, rename, and use to replace "broken" code.
- TCC 13 attendees will have access to a video of the Lab, as well. ETA unknown as of the time this readme was created
